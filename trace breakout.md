**Qullamaggie on You Need to Track Breakouts to Be A Successful Trader **

“For those who are new, I have a system with back watch lists, like every breakout or breakdown that looks good, I track it for a month. 

I track all of these stocks in this list, all the breakouts and breakdowns today, and I'm gonna track them for a month. And then I usually clean it up.

That's how you train your brain to identify good setups. You gotta track them. This is something you gotta do if you wanna be a successful trader. You gotta look at, you gotta keep track of like breakouts and gap ups with news. I just go back like a month later and see how they did. Like SOXL 30th of June, another one I passed on. All the semi stocks and this one broke out that day.”
