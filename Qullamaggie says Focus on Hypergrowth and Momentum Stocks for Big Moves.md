Qullamaggie says Focus on Hypergrowth and Momentum Stocks for Big Moves 

“The hypergrowth on this ENPH looks like it's over for now. This thing had triple digit, guys, look at this thing. Triple digit EPS and earnings growth. This is what you should be looking for. These are the stocks that can make very big moves. If you just focus on one type of stocks, just focus on the stocks that have triple digit earnings and or revenue.

Look at the growth. High double-digit, mid-high double-digit revenue growth, and over 1,000% in EPS growth. Here it was 900%. Look at the move it made. Look at the moves. You just look for setups on these types of stocks, you have a big edge. Or you can just focus on stocks with top momentum. Or you can do a combination.

Depends on how you're wired. If you have a hard time just trading pure momentum and also want the fundamentals on your side, that’s a great way of doing it.”
